## How to install

First of all, download or clone the project, navigate to the root folder and install dependencies by `npm install`.
Create a `.env` file with the port number you want to start the server on, for example `PORT=3000`.
Run `npm run build` to build the bundle.js file and last of all, `npm start` to start the server and to work on our application!
