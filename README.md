## Project Information

[Adamlink](http://www.adamlink.nl), a project of [Adamnet](http://www.adamnet.nl), have made the Linked Open Data available for us. In this data you can find collections from Amsterdam. The collections are from ‘Beeldbank Stadsarchief’, ‘Amsterdams Museum’ , ‘IISG’ and ‘OBA’.

Adamlink asked us to create an interface where everybody is able to search for images (not only the people with SPARQL knowledge). This project is made for people with a background in Amsterdam. They may have lived their, or maybe their grandmother has lived in the city. But it could also be used by a teacher who wants to learn his students more about a specific part of Amsterdam.

### Concept
---

With [eenstukjenostalgie.amsterdam](http://www.eenstukjenostalgie.amsterdam) we are helping people to collect images they will give them memories back. By choosing a location and a time period, you will receive images of your neighborhood. If you like an image, you can save it to your memories book.

The good thing about our application is that you are not only looking for the most common results. The user will get surprised about the images they will find.

The memories book will not only be about your neighborhood. You have the option to add new chapters, like: political posters, music posters or about your primary school and more.

## User Scenarios

### Create a Memories Book for your grandma's birthday
---

Anne's grandma Miep is turning 80 next week, so Anne wants to give her something special for her birthday. She wants to make a collection of images from Miep's childhood. Anne knows Miep has lived in Amsterdam her entire life and knows that she lived somewhere in the Jordaan during her childhood. Where exactly, she doesn't know.

### Create a Memories Book of your childhood
---

Erik is 48 and lives in Amsterdam. During his childhood, he lived in the Ranonkelkade, in Amsterdam North. Erik feels nostalgic and would like to relive his childhood memories.

## Linked open data

The data we use is coming from [Adamlink](http://www.adamlink.nl) and is known as Linked Open Data. This means that all of the data in the Adamlink database are linked to each other or other databases. With Linked Open Data you can easily link data from one source to another. Links are made using **URIs**, like this one:

```
<http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>
```

### SPARQL
---

Fetching data from this database is done with SPARQL. SPARQL is an RDF query language, that is, a semantic query language for databases, able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. *(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL))*

**An example of a SPARQL query we use:**

```
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX hg: <http://rdf.histograph.io/>
PREFIX geo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>
SELECT ?street ?name ?wkt WHERE {
  ?street a hg:Street .
  ?street rdfs:label ?name .
  ?street geo:hasGeometry/geo:asWKT ?wkt .
  FILTER (REGEX (?street, "Achter"))
}
```

This query fetches all the streets in Amsterdam that relate to the search term "Achter".

With SPARQL you use `PREFIX` to link to another data source. You select items from the database using `SELECT`, define the items you want to select with variables (`?name`). Selecting items from a database using SPARQL works using something called **triples**. You select an item using three variables. The first one is always the subject, the second and third one define the item and the relationship between the two.

### Our data flow

<!-- Add Actor diagram -->

## Usage

### State 1: Homepage
---

If you are arriving on the homepage you will find below the intro text memoriebooks made by others. You can search for a specific book, or just look around the images others have collected.

On the right side of the page you have the option to create your own book. You can pick a subject (person, building or blanco) and start your book.

<!-- Screenshot of homepage -->

### State 2: Selecting location and time period
---

On the second stage you will find a fullscreen map of Amsterdam. You have to select a time period by sliding the dots. You can either search for a specific street or drag the radius to a location at the map. When you are searching for a specific street, the position of the radius is changing on the map. If you want to change the size of the radius, you can select a radius in meters.

When the location and time period are as you would like, you can click on the submit button on the right to get your results.

<!-- Screenshot of new-story page -->

### State 3: Selecting pictures
---

Yes, you have your first results now! On this page you can find the images that are in the time period you have selected and in the neighborhood that the radius pointed out. When you scroll down the page the year will shown up with a nice transition, so it will be clear which year the images are from. The years are clickable, you can easily navigate through the years.

<!-- Screenshot of one selected year -->

On a hover you will find out that you can select each of the images. By clicking on the images you will add it to a red bar. At the same time a save button will shown up with the number of images you have added. You delete the image by unselecting the images or by clicking on the image in the red bar.

<!-- Screenshot of selected images in selection bar -->

You can see every image in detail by clicking on the zoom icon.

<!-- Screenshot of image in detail view -->

By the way, on every page you have the option to go back to the previous page or homepage.

If you have selected all the images you would like to save, you click on the save button on the bottom right.

### State 4: My Memories Book
---

Now you arrived at your memories book page! This is the place where you can personalize your book. You can give it a title you would like and have a collection of the photo’s you have saved. Each year has different chapters. We have created two chapters for you in the first state: your street and your neighborhood.

Each image has a text that is editable. You can change the text or add some new lines if you would like.

You are able to add new chapters. You can find them by clicking on the button on the top right. By choosing on of the them you will create a new menu item in the top bar and create a new article on the page.

<!-- Screenshot of selecting a chapter -->

In the chapter you have to fill in a input field, which will search (coming soon..) for images.
